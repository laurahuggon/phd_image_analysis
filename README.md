# PhD Experiments: Image Analysis

This repository contains Python scripts used as part of analysis pipelines for images generated during my PhD.

## Scripts

### merge_images.py
This script processes images of neurons by matching, pairing, and merging DAPI and TRITC channel images from a directory. It creates composite images with DAPI (blue) and TRITC (red) channels and saves them to an output directory.
